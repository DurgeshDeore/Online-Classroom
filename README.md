# Online Classroom Project

## Overview
The **Online Classroom** project is a web-based platform built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack**. This platform enables students and teachers to collaborate efficiently, manage courses, and conduct live sessions seamlessly.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for students and teachers.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Teachers can create and manage courses, while students can enroll and participate.
- **Course Management:** Teachers can create, update, and delete courses with materials (videos, PDFs, assignments, etc.).
- **Live Classes & Video Conferencing:** Integration with WebRTC or third-party APIs (Zoom, Jitsi) for live interactions.
- **Assignment & Exam Management:** Teachers can upload assignments, and students can submit them online.
- **Discussion Forum:** A space for students and teachers to interact and discuss topics.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Alerts for class schedules, assignments, and announcements.
- **Student Performance Tracking:** Teachers can monitor student progress through analytics.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS / Material UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary / AWS S3 for media uploads
- **Real-time Features:** WebSockets (Socket.io) for live chat and notifications
